The warning you received indicates that `apt-key` is deprecated, and it suggests managing keyring files using the `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/` directory instead. Here's how to do that for Visual Studio Code:

### 1. **Download the Microsoft GPG Key**
   First, save the GPG key to a file:
   ```bash
   wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg
   ```

### 2. **Move the GPG Key to the Trusted Directory**
   Move the `microsoft.gpg` file to the `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/` directory:
   ```bash
   sudo mv microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg
   ```

### 3. **Add the Microsoft Repository**
   Now, add the Visual Studio Code repository:
   ```bash
   sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list'
   ```

### 4. **Install Visual Studio Code**
   Finally, update your package list and install Visual Studio Code:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install code -y
   ```

This method will install Visual Studio Code without triggering the `apt-key` deprecation warning.
