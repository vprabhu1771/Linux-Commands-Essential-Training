In Fedora, package management is primarily handled using the DNF (Dandified YUM) package manager. Here are some common DNF commands for package management:

1. Installing a Package:
   
   sudo dnf install package_name
   

2. Updating Packages:
   
   sudo dnf update
   

3. Removing a Package:
   
   sudo dnf remove package_name
   

4. Searching for Packages:
   
   dnf search search_term
   

5. Listing Installed Packages:
   
   dnf list installed
   

6. Listing Available Updates:
   
   dnf list updates
   

7. Checking Package Information:
   
   dnf info package_name
   

8. Cleaning Package Cache:
   
   sudo dnf clean all
   

9. Enabling a Repository:
   
   sudo dnf config-manager --enable repository_name
   

10. Disabling a Repository:
    
    sudo dnf config-manager --disable repository_name
    

Remember to replace package_name and repository_name with the actual package or repository you're working with. Additionally, you'll need administrative privileges (sudo) for most package management tasks.

Fedora uses the RPM package format, and DNF resolves dependencies automatically, making package management relatively straightforward.
