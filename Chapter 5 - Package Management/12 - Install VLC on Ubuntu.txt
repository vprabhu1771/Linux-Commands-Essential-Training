2. Update the package list to ensure you have the latest information about available packages. Type the following command and press Enter:

   You will need to enter your password to authenticate the installation.

3. After the package list is updated, you can install VLC by running the following command:

   Confirm the installation by typing `Y` and then press Enter.

4. The system will now download and install VLC and its dependencies. This process may take a few moments, depending on your internet connection.

5. Once the installation is complete, you can launch VLC by typing `vlc` in the Terminal and pressing Enter. Alternatively, you can search for "VLC" in your application launcher and open it from there.
