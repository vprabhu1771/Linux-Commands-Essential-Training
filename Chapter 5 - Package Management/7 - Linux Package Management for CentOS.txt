CentOS, like many other Linux distributions, uses the YUM (Yellowdog Updater Modified) package manager for package management. Here are some common YUM commands for package management on CentOS:

1. Installing a Package:
   To install a package, use the yum install command followed by the package name:

   
   sudo yum install packageName
   

2. Updating Packages:
   To update all installed packages to their latest versions, use:

   
   sudo yum update
   

3. Search for Packages:
   You can search for packages using:

   
   yum search packageName
   

4. Listing Installed Packages:
   To list all installed packages, you can use:

   
   yum list installed
   

5. Removing a Package:
   To remove a package, use the yum remove command followed by the package name:

   
   sudo yum remove packageName
   

6. Listing Available Repositories:
   To list the available repositories, use:

   
   yum repolist
   

7. Adding a New Repository:
   You can add third-party repositories by creating a .repo file in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory.

These are some basic YUM commands for CentOS package management. Remember to run most of these commands with superuser privileges (sudo) to make system-wide changes.
