grep "pattern" file.txt

The `grep` command is used to search for a specified pattern in a text file. Here's an example of how you might use it:

Suppose you have a text file called `file.txt` with the following content:


This is an example file.
It contains some text.
You can search for patterns using grep.
Let's try searching for the word "example."


To search for the pattern "example" in `file.txt`, you would run the following command in your terminal:

bash
grep "example" file.txt


The output of this command will be:


This is an example file.
Let's try searching for the word "example."


In this example, `grep` searched for the pattern "example" in the `file.txt` and displayed the lines that contained the matching text.
